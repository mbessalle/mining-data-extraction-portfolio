Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - July 8, 2024) - **LaFleur Minerals Inc.

As announced by the Company on June 17, 2024, the Company entered into an arm's length Option Agreement (the "**Agreement** ") with Abcourt Mines Inc. ("**ABI** ") pursuant to which ABI granted the Company the option (the "**Option** ") to acquire all of ABI's title and interest in the Property. In accordance with the terms and conditions of the Option Agreement, the Company:

  * paid ABI the initial cash payment of $500,000 on June 20, 2024, after which it acquired a 25% interest in the Property; and  
  

  * elected to accelerate the completion of the outstanding payments totalling $1,500,0000 and complete such payment through the issuance of common shares in the capital of the Company (the "**Shares** ") to acquire the remaining 75% interest in the Property. As such, the Company issued ABI 4,299,211 Shares with a deemed price of $0.3489 per Share. The Shares are subject to a statutory hold period of four months plus a day from the date of issuance in accordance with applicable securities legislation.



Following the Company's exercise of the Option, the Company has:

  * granted ABI a two percent (2%) net smelter returns royalty on certain mineral claims comprising the Property; and   
  

  * assumed ABI's obligations with respect to certain royalties currently existing on the Property.



The Property is located within the gold and critical minerals rich Abitibi Greenstone Belt, approximately 60 km north of the city of Val-d'Or and adjacent to the Swanson gold deposit, Abcourt-Barvue base metal (Zn-Pb-Ag) mine, and the Courville and Jolin gold deposits. The Property claims contain the same geological stratigraphy that hosts the Swanson gold deposit, extending the favourable strike length a total of 30 km along a NW to SE trend and over a width of 4 to 9 km. The Property is composed of alternating porphyritic andesites, basalts, rhyolites, and felsic tuffs belonging to the Figury Group as well as syenites, monzonites, diorites, tonalites and granodiorite intrusives. The Property includes both orogenic-type vein (structurally-controlled) and shear-hosted gold-bearing mineralization, with 17 gold (Au) and numerous gold-rich polymetallic (Ag, Cu, Zn, Pb and Mo) showings.

Gold showings on the Property are referenced from the Québec government SIGÉOM geological database and include the:
