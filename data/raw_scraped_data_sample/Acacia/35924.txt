# NevGold Announces Formation of BC Subsidiary, Entering Into Option Agreement with Eagle Plains Resources, and Planned Going Public Transaction

Vancouver, British Columbia, May 31, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NevGold Corp. (“**NevGold** ” or the “**Company** ”) **(****TSXV****:NAU****) (****OTC****Q****X****:NAUFF****) (****Frankfurt:****5E50**) is pleased to announce that it has established a new British Columbia subsidiary, 1416753 B.C. Ltd. (“SubCo”) to focus on its high-grade Ptarmigan silver-copper-lead-zinc project in southeastern BC. SubCo has also entered into an option agreement dated May 26, 2023 (the “Option Agreement”) to acquire a portfolio of advanced exploration assets including two copper-gold-silver projects and three lithium projects in British Columbia (collectively, the “Option Projects”) from Eagle Plains Resources Ltd. (“EPL” or the “Optionor”, TSXV:EPL). The Option Agreement and Option Projects are described in more detail below.  


NevGold intends to prepare SubCo for a future subsequent going public transaction through either a spin-out, merger, or sale.

**_Highlights_**

  * **Unlock****s****immediate value from Ptarmigan with 25 million shares****of****SubCo** **being issued to****NevGold****to the benefit of****NevGold****shareholders;**
  * Further exposure for NevGold shareholders to five promising copper, gold, silver, and lithium projects through the Option Agreement with EPL;
  * Large land positions totalling over 310 km2 (or 31,028 hectares) in highly prospective districts in Southeast British Columbia, Toodoggone, and Atlin (see Figure 2);
  * Ptarmigan (NevGold), Lost Horse (Option Project), and Acacia (Option Project) have numerous “drill-ready” targets;
  * Operating partnership between experienced NevGold and EPL teams on BC projects;
  * **Allows****NevGold****to maintain****100% focus on Western USA oxide, heap-leach gold projects including Nutmeg Mountain (Idaho), Limousine Butte (Nevada), and Cedar Wash (Nevada)**



**NevGold** **CEO, Brandon Bonifacio****, comments:** _“_ _The creation of_ _the_ _focused_ _British Columbia_ _SubCo_ _extracts immediate value_ _for_ _our shareholders_ _with_ _25 million shares being issued to_ _NevGold_ _. The_ _SubCo_ _provides exposure to a_ _highly prospective portfolio of_ _advanced exploration_ _assets_ _including high-grade silver-lead zinc, copper, gold, and lithium_ _in B_ _ritish Columbia_ _which can be financed_ _separately_ _without impacting_ _the_ _NevGold_ _capital structure_ _and_ _technical resources_ _.__Ptarmigan_ _has significant value, but_ _within the_ _NevGold_ _portfolio_ _gets zero value ascribed due to our_ _focus on our_ _gold assets_ _in the Western USA_ _._ _P_ _artnering with Eagle Plains allows us to_ _strengthen our presence in B_ _C_ _while_ _also_ _build_ _ing_ _an efficient, well-established_ _operating platform.__Th_ _e_ _transaction allows_ _NevGold_ _to remain laser focused on_ _being_ _one of the go-to companies_ _for oxide, heap-leach gold in the Western USA and_ _it_ _will deliver tremendous value to our shareholders as_ _the_ _BC focused company is daylighted_ _to the public market.”_

**Eagle Plains****VP Exploration, Chuck****Downie****,****comments****:** _“_ _We_ _are_ _looking_ _forward_ _to_ _working_ _alongside_ _the_ _NevGold_ _team to_ _advance_ _these_ _BC_ _critical_ _metals_ _projects_ _.__We_ _believe_ _the synergies_ _between_ _our_ _companies_ _will_ _fast-__track_ _discovery_ _potential_ _and_ _create_ _value for_ _both_ _Eagle Plains and_ _NevGold_ _shareholders_ _.__”_

**_The_**** _Option Agreement_**  
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Option Agreement, the Optionor granted to SubCo the sole and exclusive irrevocable right and option (the “Option”) to acquire an undivided 100% interest in the Option Projects free and clear of any encumbrance, other than certain net smelter return (“NSR”) royalties.

In connection with the Option Agreement, NevGold intends to transfer its Ptarmigan property to SubCo in consideration for 25,000,000 SubCo common shares, representing 100% of the outstanding share capital before the share issuances under the Option Agreement.

SubCo may exercise the Option at its sole discretion by completing the following:

  1. Issuing the following SubCo shares to EPL (the Optionor):



(i)      **on or before the Option closing d****ate, 5,000,000****SubCo****s****hares; and**  
(ii)     **on or within 10 business days of the closing of****a going public transaction****involving****SubCo****, an additional****5,000,000****SubCo** **s****hares****; and**

  1. **I****ncurring the****minimum****e****xpenditures on the****Option****P****rojects****:**



(iii)      **on or before****December 31, 2023, $500,000 of e****xpenditures; and**  
(iv)      **on or before December 31, 2024, $500,000 of****additional e****xpenditures.**

Upon the exercise of the Option, SubCo has agreed to grant EPL a 2% NSR royalty on certain Option Projects without underlying royalties, with a buy-down option for SubCo of a 1% NSR royalty for C$1,000,000. Some of the Option Projects are subject to underlying royalties. The NSR royalties on each individual project will be capped at an aggregate 2% NSR.

Upon SubCo completing a going public transaction, EPL has agreed to enter into an Investor Rights Agreement with the resulting issuer in which EPL will agree to certain resale conditions on the shares it holds of the resulting issuer for as long as it holds greater than 5% of the outstanding shares. If SubCo does not complete a going public transaction by June 30, 2024, or such later date agreed between the parties, EPL may terminate the Option Agreement and the Option Projects will revert to EPL.

The obligations of SubCo to complete the transactions contemplated by the Option Agreement are subject to the receipt by NevGold and SubCo of all required regulatory approvals, including the approval of the TSX Venture Exchange. The SubCo shares issued under the terms of the Option Agreement will be subject to an indefinite hold period under applicable securities laws that will expire four months and one day after the later of the date of issuance of the SubCo shares and the date that SubCo has become a reporting issuer in any jurisdiction of Canada.

**Ptarmigan**(10,048 ha) is a district-scale, high-grade polymetallic project located in southeast British Columbia. The project has had approximately C$7 million spent historically on geophysical and geochemical analysis, surface mapping, and over 14,000 meters of diamond drilling. Some of the high-grade historical results include:

  * Drill results: 
    * 3.65 m of 2,455 g/t Ag, 1.00 g/t Au, 0.91% Cu 
      * Includes 0.33 m of 22,945 g/t Ag, 5.75 g/t Au, 8.24% Cu
    * 1.16 m of 2,315 g/t Ag, 1.64 g/t Au, 1.10% Cu
    * 6.80 m of 452 g/t Ag, 0.52 g/t Au, 0.26% Cu
    * 3.69 m of 635 g/t Ag, 0.82 g/t Au, 0.33% Cu
    * 6.41 m of 96 g/t Ag, 0.36 g/t Au, 0.20% Cu, 3.70% Pb
    * 4.90 m of 120 g/t Ag, 3.22% Pb
  * Geochemical samplings results: 
    * 1,171 g/t Ag, 0.96 g/t of Au, 0.30% Cu, 29.7% Pb
    * 2,210 g/t Ag, 1.8 g/t Au, 1.4% Cu
    * 3,188 g/t Ag, 0.22% Cu, 29.4% Pb



Additional details relating to the geology and interpretation of the drill results for Ptarmigan are contained in the NevGold’s public disclosure and other material filed on SEDAR. Based on the best information available, NevGold’s Qualified Person is of the opinion that the historical drilling was conducted in accordance with current industry best practices, norms and protocols with respect to drill sample security, integrity, core logging, splitting of core, insertion of blanks and standards and transportation to an industry-accredited lab facility.

**Lost Horse** (2170 ha) is strategically-positioned and surrounded by active exploration and drilling by New Gold Inc.  and the project has similar geological characteristics including numerous prospective copper and gold occurrences. Historical work at Lost Horse includes surface mapping, geochemical and geophysical analysis. Eagle Plains has submitted an application to the BC Ministry for Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation for a Multi Year Area Based Permit (“MYAB”) which includes diamond drilling.

**Acacia** (4857 ha) is located 60 km northeast of Kamloops, BC and is considered to have excellent potential for volcanogenic massive sulphide (“VMS”) deposits. The project is situated southeast and on the same geological trend as the Rea Gold, K7, and Twin 3 deposits, and the previously-mined Samatosum Mine which was in production from 1989-1992. Historical work at the project includes surface mapping, geochemical and geophysical analysis, channel sampling, and approximately 4,450 meters of drilling. The project is fully permitted with a Multi Year Area Based Permit (“MYAB”) issued through the BC Ministry for Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation. Some of the key historical results include:

  * Drill results: 
    * 0.72 g/t Au over 10.3 meters
    * 3.9 g/t Au over 1.0 meters
    * 3.6 g/t Au over 1.0 meters
  * Channel sampling results: 
    * 1.78 g/t au over 10.0 meters
    * 15.5 g/t Au, 9.3 g/t Ag, 0.84% Pb, 3.7% Zn over 0.6 meters  
  




Based on the best information available, NevGold’s Qualified Person is of the opinion that the historical drilling was conducted in accordance with current industry best practices, norms and protocols with respect to drill sample security, integrity, core logging, splitting of core, insertion of blanks and standards and transportation to an industry-accredited lab facility.

**Fin****d****lith** (2307 ha) is located 35 km northwest of Cranbrook, BC. The property is underlain by a granitic batholith as well as pegmatitic intrusions. Numerous beryl occurrences have been documented on the property which indicates the pegmatites are very prospective for lithium.

**Surprise****Lake**(4492 ha) and **Toodoggone** (7154 ha) are early-stage projects that were acquired based on favorable regional geochemical results and prospective geology that indicate the potential for lithium mineralization in pegmatites. Neither property has previously been evaluated for lithium mineralization, and both are considered highly prospective for lithium bearing pegmatites.

Technical information contained in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Derick Unger, CPG, the Company’s Vice President, Exploration, who is NevGold’s qualified person under National Instrument 43-101 and responsible for technical matters of this release.
