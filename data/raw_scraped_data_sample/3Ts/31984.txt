# Independence Gold Acquires Laidman Project, British Columbia and Provides an Update on the 3Ts Project

Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - March 2, 2023) - **Independence Gold Corp. (TSXV: IGO) (OTCQB: IEGCF)**(the "Company") is pleased to announce the Company's newly acquired Laidman Project covering 10,800 hectares and located 300 metres ("m") northwest of its 100% owned 3Ts gold and silver project. This project area is located 16 kilometres ("km") west of Artemis Gold Inc.'s Blackwater Project, and approximately 185 km southwest of Prince George, British Columbia.

The Laidman Project is comprised of six mineral tenures, largely underlain by the Laidman Batholith, a regional-scale quartz monzonite intrusion of Late Jurassic age. The Laidman Batholith extends east toward the Blackwater Project held by Artemis Gold Inc. 

The area within the Laidman Project is relatively underexplored and has been subjected to some larger scale regional surveys undertaken including Geoscience BC. Along the periphery of the intrusion several mineral showings have been noted. Mineralization similar to the 3Ts Project have been discovered close to the contact zone between the intrusions and the local country rock. Although the 3Ts Project and the Blackwater Gold Project are the most advanced mineral deposits in the area, other underexplored local showings exist, including the Key West showing (MinFile 093F 091). This is a low-sulphidation epithermal gold and silver showing similar to that at the 3Ts Project and hosted within Hazelton volcaniclastic country rock, which historically produced surface samples grading up to 12.65 grams per tonne ("g/t") gold and 81.4 g/t silver. Other showings located around the intrusive body host structurally controlled porphyry copper and molybdenum mineralization. The batholith underlying the Laidman project has a 10 km southern edge which represents exploration targets for both epithermal and porphyry style mineralization. 

Exploration for 2023 will focus initially on digitizing existing historical datasets as well as field reconnaissance, mapping and prospecting. The Company has set an initial budget of $50,000 for the year.
