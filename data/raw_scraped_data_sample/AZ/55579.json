    "description": "\n\n<p id=\"temp_ReleaseStart\"><span class=\"legendSpanClass\"><span class=\"xn-location\">VANCOUVER, BC</span></span>, <span class=\"legendSpanClass\"><span class=\"xn-chron\">June 12, 2024</span></span> /CNW/ -- Yukon Metals Corp. (CSE: YMC) (Frankfurt: E770) has doubled its land position from an initial 18,000 hectares (ha) acquired as part of the Berdahl property transaction announced <span class=\"xn-chron\">Jan 15, 2024</span>, to 36,000 ha after considerable staking over the last few months expanding the initially acquired <span class=\"xn-location\">Yukon</span> portfolio.</p>\n<p class=\"prntaj\">Areas of focus in this staking program were the high priority AZ property, surrounding its Talbot property, as well as a new set of prospective claims near the <span class=\"xn-location\">Alaska</span> Highway, which has been named \"Fairway\".</p>\n<p class=\"prntaj\">\"During these past months, prior to Closing of the acquisition, the Company has been busy staking ground around two key properties, AZ and Talbot, as well as staking new claims at Fairway. AZ is a high-priority potential copper-gold porphyry asset, while Talbot hosts a substantial gold and silver anomaly. Both AZ and Fairway are within 20km of the <span class=\"xn-location\">Alaska</span> Highway,\" said Rory Quinn, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"I look forward to sharing ongoing details of what is going to be a busy exploration season.\"</p>\n<p><b>AZ &amp; FAIRWAY</b></p>\n<p class=\"prntaj\">The AZ and Fairway claim area was prospected by <span class=\"xn-person\">Ron Berdahl</span> in the early 1990's while working for Noranda (Yukon Assessment 91-051 1991). Copper mineralization is noted on the AZ property; <b>Rock float assays returned an average of 10% Cu, 126 g/t Ag and 7.08 g/t Au</b> from four samples in 1993, noted in assessment report 093101 (press release <span class=\"xn-chron\">June 3, 2024</span>). The author further stated, \"anomalous copper gold-bearing skarn underneath the float showing suggests a local source for the mineralized float on the property.\" In this region, small placer operations were active on Sanpete, Pan and Gold Creeks in the 1930's.</p>\n<p class=\"prntaj\">On behalf of the Company, prior to Closing, <span class=\"xn-person\">Ron Berdahl</span> staked the area north of the southern AZ claims, which covered an additional 7,625 ha in 372 additional claims (see Figure 1). These claims include a gossanous area on Chair Mountain associated with northwest trending faults near the contact zone of the Nikolai Volcanics. Only 11 samples were taken in this area in 1987. In 1989 prospectors returned and blasted trenches near Sanpete creek and found quartz veining with sulfides. One 25cm sample #62951 (true width unknown) assayed 51 ppb Au, 5.6 ppm Ag, 1,400 ppm Cu, 8,880 ppm Pb and &gt;20,000 ppm Zn (Assessment report 092798). Zinc was never re-assayed.</p>\n<p class=\"prntaj\">Another sample in the same trench area assayed 59 ppb Au, 1.2 ppm Ag, 278 ppm Cu, 429 ppm Pb, 13,380 ppm Zn (grab sample #62954). Follow-up work has never been completed in this area.</p>\n<p class=\"prntaj\">A similar geological setting occurs with the presence of the volcanic rocks and limestone on the newly staked Fairway Property. This package of mineralization is highly prospective with 10km strike length (see Figure 1) through Nikolai Volcanics and Chitistone Limestone mapped by the Geological Survey of <span class=\"xn-location\">Canada</span> (OF 2188). The Fairway Property adds 2,552 ha in 126 new claims.</p>\n<p class=\"prntaj\">Both the entirety of the AZ and Fairway properties are 10 and 18 kilometers respectively from the <span class=\"xn-location\">Alaska</span> Highway and may be accessed by short helicopter flights. Chair Mountain was previously accessed by trail.</p>\n<div class=\"PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference\" id=\"DivAssetPlaceHolder1864\"><p><a href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2436398/Yukon_Metals_Figure_1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Figure 1: AZ Property including the new AZ North Addition.

New Fairway Property south of Tchawsahmon Lake.\"></img></a></p>\n</div><p class=\"prntaj\"><b>TALBOT</b></p>\n<p class=\"prntaj\">Several key factors occur in this area such as a <b>4km gold in soil and talus fines anomaly. Additionally, there are float quartzite rock samples such as #40868 which assayed 3.67 g/t Au, 832 g/t Ag and 1,800 g/t Cu and float quartzite rock sample #40870 which assayed 3.59 g/t Au. </b>The anomaly and rock samples were noted in assessment report 096342 (press release <span class=\"xn-chron\">June 3, 2024</span>). Overall, there is continuity in the geology and other positive ridge and spur samples taken on the Talbot property by <span class=\"xn-person\">Ryan Gold</span> in 2012.</p>\n<p class=\"prntaj\">Thus, it became apparent that the Company should stake additional claims in the area to cover the major anomaly and the ridge and spur smaller anomalies. The Company added 370 claims covering an additional 7,689 ha of exploration ground. The additional ground which covers eastward through the psammitic and pelitic schists and the surrounding Ruby Range batholith (Yukon Geological Survey, OF 2011-2). The Ruby Range batholith has numerous porphyry occurrences along with other intrusive rocks in the coastal range plutonic suites (Fonseca and Bradshaw, Open File 2005-5). The Talbot Property is proximal to <span class=\"xn-location\">Burwash Landing</span> and <span class=\"xn-location\">Destruction Bay</span> on the <span class=\"xn-location\">Alaska</span> Highway and is easily accessible by helicopter from nearby roads. <span class=\"xn-location\">Destruction Bay</span> is 260 km west of <span class=\"xn-location\">Whitehorse</span>.</p>\n<div class=\"PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference\" id=\"DivAssetPlaceHolder2045\"><p><a href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2436399/Yukon_Metals_Figure_2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Figure 2: Additional staking on Talbot Property.\" src=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2436399/Yukon_Metals_Figure_2.jpg?p=original\" title=\"Figure 2: Additional staking on Talbot Property.\"></img></a></p>\n</div><p class=\"prntaj\">The technical information contained in this news release has been reviewed and approved by <span class=\"xn-person\">Peter Born</span>, Ph.D., P.Geo, who is a Qualified Person defined under National Instrument 43-101.</p>\n<p><b>About Yukon Metals Corp.</b></p>\n<p class=\"prntaj\">Yukon Metals represents a property portfolio built on over 30 years of prospecting by the <b>Berdahl family, the prospecting team behind Snowline Gold's (SGD) portfolio of primary gold assets</b>.
