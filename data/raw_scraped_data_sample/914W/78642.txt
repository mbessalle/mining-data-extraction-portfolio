# Mustang Energy Corp. Enters Option Agreement to Acquire Skyharbour’s 914W Uranium Project and Welcomes Jordan Trimble as Strategic Advisor

VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Nov. 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mustang Energy Corp. (CSE:MEC, OTC:MECPF, FRA:92T) (“**Mustang** ” or the “**Company** ”) is excited to announce that it has entered into a strategic option agreement (the “**Agreement** ”) with Skyharbour Resources Ltd. (TSX-V: SYH) (“**Skyharbour** ”) dated November 12, 2024 to acquire an undivided 75% interest (the “**Option** ”) in Skyharbour’s 914W Uranium Project (the “**914W Project** ”), located in the Athabasca Basin of Northern Saskatchewan. The Option marks an important step for Mustang as it seeks to expand its presence in a promising uranium district. Additionally, Mustang is pleased to welcome Jordan Trimble, President and CEO of Skyharbour, as a Strategic Advisor to the Company, bringing valuable industry insights and expertise to Mustang’s growing portfolio.

“Being granted the Option to acquire a majority interest in the 914W Uranium Project is an exciting milestone for Mustang as we look to expand our footprint in and around the Athabasca Basin, a promising uranium district,” commented Nick Luksha, CEO of Mustang. “With Jordan Trimble joining as a Strategic Advisor, we are gaining invaluable expertise that will strengthen our exploration efforts and help us unlock the potential of the 914W Project. This partnership aligns with our commitment to building a robust portfolio of high-impact assets while supporting sustainable development practices in the region.”

“The 914W Project’s accessible location, combined with promising geological indicators similar to those seen in the nearby uranium occurrences at Scurry Rainbow Zone E1 and the Don Lake Trenches2, underscores the potential for discovery. With much of the 914W Project remaining underexplored, we see an opportunity to unlock further value through targeted exploration,” said Lynde Guillaume, Technical Advisor for Mustang.

Jordan Trimble, President and CEO of Skyharbour stated “As Skyharbour becomes a shareholder and project partner alongside Mustang at the 914W Project under the Agreement, I am looking forward to working with the Mustang team to advance the asset over the coming years. We believe there is a strong discovery upside potential at the early-stage project, and we are optimistic that Mustang will be able to unlock value at the property.”

**About the 914W Uranium Project**

The 914W Project is situated approximately 48 km southwest of Cameco’s Key Lake Operation, offering excellent logistics and access via Highway 914. The 914W Project is strategically positioned within the Western Wollaston Domain, known for unconformity-related and pegmatite-hosted uranium (or “**U** ”) mineralization.

The project host favorable geology with local graphite bearing assemblages. Immediately to the north of the 914W Project is the Scurry Rainbow Zone E1 and the Don Lake Trenches2, where up to 1,288 ppm U was encountered in drill hole ML-11, and surface prospecting revealed up to 0.64% U3O8 in a trench at Don Lake Zone E2.

While historical exploration conducted several geophysical and geological surveys over portions of the property, most of the 914W Project remains underexplored. Mustang sees substantial potential for advancing uranium and rare earth element exploration on the 914W Project.
