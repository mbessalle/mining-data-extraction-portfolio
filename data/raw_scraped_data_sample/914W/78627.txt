# Skyharbour Enters into Agreement with Mustang Energy to Option its 914W Uranium Project Located in the Athabasca Basin, Saskatchewan

Vancouver, BC, Nov. 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **Skyharbour Resources Ltd.**** (TSX-V:** [**SYH**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=TQ_e6Fr4rv7Yv12JUpeTyqX9H_tZy-aByZE0oyCir0XChSZBqZXWnPtYjatcp_p9ekIBPwQ8Astgp4ffPF1iFQ==)**) (OTCQX:**[**SYHBF**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=uQjvdVNsQKWh2yFS7S4G2iB-Cf-tI4Clu3mcphiJ6Oi12ZF9r6KwUxA0gnVwCovdStYtQbIMOOToewhJGwOMj3c3ux8abe99rmB5rsvKrSc=)**)****(Frankfurt:**[**SC1P**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=mf5xIS_qjJJWPx_lABobjFTgZKIQr1n6XBrAZAbMJI8ydJHJuSs3ZRIIQdghf8r50l0nX-Q3TlPPmfaPh6if-K1Xk7VnuZX2-Hf85FYWC6Pjx7jpQ1JdF4X5IvZTCZ64)**)**(“Skyharbour” or the “Company”), is pleased to announce that it has entered into an option agreement (“Agreement”) with Mustang Energy Corp. (the “Optionee” or “Mustang”), whereby the Optionee may acquire a 75% interest in the Company’s 914W Uranium Project (the “Property”). The Property consists of a total of one mineral claim covering approximately 1,260 hectares located in the Athabasca Basin, Northern Saskatchewan.

**Terms of the Agreement:**

Pursuant to the Agreement, Mustang may acquire a 75% interest in the Property by (i) issuing common shares in the capital of the Optionee (“Shares”) having an aggregate value of CAD $480,000; (ii) making aggregate cash payments of CAD $275,000; and (iii) incurring an aggregate of CAD $800,000 in exploration expenditures on the Property over a three-year period, as follows:

 

**Date** |  **Cash Payments** |  **Exploration Expenditures** |  **Value of Shares Issued**  
---|---|---|---  
On Closing |  $15,000 |  N/A |  $30,000(1)

Skyharbour will retain an NSR royalty of two percent (2%) whereby Mustang shall have the right at any time to purchase one-half (1/2) of the NSR royalty from Skyharbour in consideration of the payment to Skyharbour of CAD $1,000,000, thereby leaving Skyharbour with a one percent (1%) NSR royalty. 

**914W Property Summary:**

The 914W Project consists of one claim covering 1,260 hectares approximately 48 km southwest of Cameco’s Key Lake Operation. Highway 914 runs through the western edge of the project, providing excellent access for exploration. Historical geological mapping of the property and the surrounding area has shown that the project is predominantly underlain by prospective Wollaston Supergroup pelitic and psammitic to arkosic gneisses of the Western Wollaston Domain, which host significant unconformity-related uranium mineralization further to the north in the Athabasca Basin as well as pegmatite-hosted uranium mineralization elsewhere in the Wollaston Domain.

Despite the project’s proximity to Highway 914 and prospective geology, the project has seen limited modern exploration work. The earliest work on the 914W property included airborne EM and magnetic surveys and ground geological reconnaissance in 1968-1970, lake water and sediment sampling in 1976, ground VLF-EM, magnetic, and radiometric surveys, geological mapping, trenching, as well as sampling on the project and surrounding areas. Immediately to the north of the 914W property, prospecting led to the discovery of the Scurry Rainbow Zone E (SMDI1961) and the Don Lake Trenches (SMDI 1983), where up to 1,288 ppm U was encountered in drill hole ML-1 (SMDI1961) in a pyroxene-rich unit, and surface prospecting revealed up to 0.64% U3O8 in a trench at Don Lake Zone E (SMDI 1983). More recently, the project has seen airborne geophysical coverage by helicopter-borne VTEM (southern half) in 2005 and Tempest TDEM (northern half) in 2007, with prospecting, geological mapping, rock/sediment sampling and lake sediment sampling occurring on the project and surrounding areas in 2005-2007. The project remains underexplored and prospective for unconformity-related and pegmatite-hosted uranium and REE’s.

**Qualified Person:**

The technical information in this news release has been prepared in accordance with the Canadian regulatory requirements set out in National Instrument 43-101 and reviewed and approved by David Billard, P.Geo., a Consulting Geologist for Skyharbour as well as a Qualified Person. 

**About Skyharbour Resources Ltd.:**

Skyharbour holds an extensive portfolio of uranium exploration projects in Canada's Athabasca Basin and is well positioned to benefit from improving uranium market fundamentals with interest in twenty-nine projects, ten of which are drill-ready, covering over 580,000 hectares (over 1.4 million acres) of land. Skyharbour has acquired from Denison Mines, a large strategic shareholder of the Company, a 100% interest in the Moore Uranium Project, which is located 15 kilometres east of Denison's Wheeler River project and 39 kilometres south of Cameco's McArthur River uranium mine. Moore is an advanced-stage uranium exploration property with high-grade uranium mineralization at the Maverick Zone that returned drill results of up to 6.0% U3O8 over 5.9 metres, including 20.8% U3O8 over 1.5 metres at a vertical depth of 265 metres. Adjacent to the Moore Project is the Russell Lake Uranium Project, in which Skyharbour is an operator with joint-venture partner Rio Tinto. The project hosts several high-grade uranium drill intercepts over a large property area with robust exploration upside potential. The Company is actively advancing these projects through exploration and drill programs.

Skyharbour also has joint ventures with industry leader Orano Canada Inc., Azincourt Energy, and Thunderbird Resources (previously Valor) at the Preston, East Preston, and Hook Lake Projects respectively. The Company also has several active earn-in option partners, including CSE-listed Basin Uranium Corp. at the Mann Lake Uranium Project; CSE-listed Medaro Mining Corp. at the Yurchison Project; TSX-V listed North Shore Uranium at the Falcon Project; UraEx Resources at the South Dufferin and Bolt Projects; Hatchet Uranium at the Highway Project; Mustang Energy at the 914W Project; and TSX-V listed Terra Clean Energy (previously Tisdale) at the South Falcon East Project which hosts the Fraser Lakes Zone B uranium and thorium deposit. In aggregate, Skyharbour has now signed earn-in option agreements with partners that total over $41 million in partner-funded exploration expenditures, over $30 million worth of shares being issued, and over $22 million in cash payments coming into Skyharbour, assuming that these partner companies complete their entire earn-ins at the respective projects.

Skyharbour's goal is to maximize shareholder value through new mineral discoveries, committed long-term partnerships, and the advancement of exploration projects in geopolitically favourable jurisdictions.
